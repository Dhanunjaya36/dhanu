# K-Means Clustering Tutorial: Optimizing the Choice of 'k'

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning tutorial created for the Machine Learning and Neural Networks Individual Assignment. The focus of this project is **K-Means Clustering**, specifically addressing the challenge of selecting the optimal number of clusters ($k$).

## Contents
* **`kmeans_tutorial.pdf`**: The written tutorial explaining the theory behind the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.
* **`kmeans_code.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the full Python implementation, data generation, and accessible visualizations.
* **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Key Techniques Covered
1.  **Data Generation**: Creating synthetic blobs using `sklearn.datasets`.
2.  **The Elbow Method**: Visualizing Inertia to find the inflection point.
3.  **Silhouette Analysis**: Validating cluster consistency mathematically.
4.  **Accessibility**: Using colorblind-friendly palettes (Viridis) for all plots.

## How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook kmeans_code.ipynb`
